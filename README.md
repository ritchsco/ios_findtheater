# ios_findtheater
iOS application 

This was a class project myself and a class mate had worked on together. The goal of the project was to use features we had not learned in class.
We decided to make an application that displays all of the current movies playing at Cineplex theaters, the show times and the theater nearest to you.
If you found a movie you wanted to go to see you could click on it and it would bring up a map giving you directions to the theater you chose based 
on the list of theaters nearest to you. 

There is also the ability to rate movies and leave reviews on them within the application.
