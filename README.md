# ios_findtheater
iOS application 

This was a class project myself and a class mate had worked on together. 

Programming Language: Swift Development Environment: Xcode 10.3, deployment target is minimum iOS 12.4, iPhone XR Simulator

Purpose: The purpose of our app is to help users plan their movie night by discovering movies that are currently playing in theatres, soon to be in theatres, and highest rated movies of all. Users can view movie details and summary, save movies to their Favourites list and set date reminder notification for a movie's theatre release dates. The app provides a Map and Directions feature, and allows user to post discussion comments. The app allows users to register for an account and securely authenticate user logins with Firebase.

Result: Our team received a project grade of 88%.
